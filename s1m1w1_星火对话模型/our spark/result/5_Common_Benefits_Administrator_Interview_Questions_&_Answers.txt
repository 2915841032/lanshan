five common benefits administrator interview questions and our sample answers
for you to use as inspiration as you prepare your own responses.1. What
experience do you have as a benefits administrator?Hiring managers ask this
straightforward benefits administrator interview question to see if you have
work experience in the field and to gauge what you can do for them based on
your impact on previous employers. Example answerWhen responding to this
benefits administrator interview question, be as detailed and comprehensive as
possible and highlight at least one accomplishment. Tie your former experience
to the role you’re interviewing for whenever possible. For example:“In my
current company, I worked my way up from benefits coordinator to benefits
administrator and have been in this role for the last five years. In this
role, I recently saved the company more than 20K in annual expenses by
renegotiating vendor contracts and onboarding new vendors as needed. I
understand that your department relies heavily on vendor relationships. I’d
like to apply the negotiation and relationship-building skills I have
sharpened in my current role to help you get the best vendor contracts
possible.”If you do not have work experience as a benefits administrator,
focus on your previous roles and how they prepared you for this job, and talk
about your transferable skills, such as leadership, interpersonal skills and
ability to multitask. If you’re interviewing for your first job, you might
answer this benefits administrator interview question like so: “While I do not
have direct experience as a benefits specialist, I did learn a great deal
about dental and health insurance, COBRA and compliance issues as an intern at
XYZ Company, and I received my Certified Employee Benefits Specialist
certification from Wharton Business School.”2. How have you worked on career
development in the past year?Hiring managers often ask about career
development to assess how serious you are about your career, your drive and
initiative, if you are goal-oriented and if your goals align with theirs.
Example answer:When responding to this benefits administrator interview
question, think about what you’ve done to get to this point and what specific
actions you’ve taken in the last year to develop your benefits administrator
skills, ending with the most recent undertaking. Your answer might be
something like this: “I think it is important to participate in career
development for a successful and meaningful career. In the past year, I took
courses offered by the International Foundation of Employee Benefit Plans to
review the lessons I learned when I got my certification in compensation and
benefits. I also attended a seminar focused on leadership techniques and what
people should do to improve their leadership ability. While both experiences
were extremely informative, the seminar made me realize I was ready to take on
a managerial role.”3. How would you lead your direct reports?Interviewers
typically ask about how you might lead others whether or not you are applying
for a role that requires leadership.That’s because many potential employers
believe job candidates with leadership skills are more confident, inspire
others and are more apt to take on challenges. Potential employers also ask
this question to get a feel for your relationship-building skills.Example
answer:When answering leadership-focused interview questions for benefits
administrators, define your understanding of leadership and how it relates to
your professional experience. Provide specific anecdotes of how you have
demonstrated leadership in the workplace, school, or community. Your answer
might be something like: “As a benefits administrator, I would play a direct
role in coordinating tasks but I would not micromanage my benefits
specialists. Instead, I would use one-on-one meetings to ensure everyone
understands what is supposed to get done, and then I would leave each employee
to his or her designated task. I would clarify that anyone can come to me
should a problem arise.”4. What do you think is the most important skill for a
benefits administrator?When potential employers ask this benefits
administrator interview question, it is usually to get an idea about how much
you know about the job, what your priorities are and if your skills match
their needs. Example answer: To answer this question, think about the skills
from the job description and how they match your own. If you have worked as a
benefits administrator, then recall the skill you used most or the one that
was most valuable to the job. If you don’t have experience as a benefits
administrator then recall the job description and match your strongest soft
skill to the job description. Tell the employer how you think the skill you
chose can benefit the company.For example:“I think the most important skill
for a benefits administrator is decision-making. Benefits administrators have
to make decisions regarding their teams to ensure everyone is using their
skills for the benefit of the company. The administrator also plays an
important role in analyzing and choosing the benefit plans for the business.
Someone in this position would have to take the time to weigh the pros and
cons to ensure the best choice is made for the majority of stakeholders in the
business.”5. Why are you interested in this position?Potential employers often

specialist for eight years, I am thoroughly versed in benefits administration,
but I am ready for a new challenge. I want this position because I believe I
have the organization, communication, leadership and business skills your
department needs to grow over the next fiscal year.” Benefits administrator
